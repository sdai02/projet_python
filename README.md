# Server Response Handler

This script is designed to interact with a server, process the server's responses, and perform various tasks based on the content of the responses. It supports operations like solving math problems, decoding base85/base32/base64 encoded messages, decoding morse and braille, converting RGB to color names, and more. It also handles file saving and retrieval to manage the answers.

## Features

- **Math Problem Solver**: Detects and solves simple math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
- **Base Decoding**: Decodes messages encoded in base85, base32, or base64.
- **Morse Code Decoding**: Decodes messages in morse code.
- **Braille Decoding**: Decodes messages in braille.
- **Hexadecimal Decoding**: Decodes messages in hexadecimal format and passes them for further processing.
- **RGB to Color Name**: Converts RGB values into color names using the `webcolors` library.
- **File Management**: Saves and retrieves answers from a text file (`answers.txt`).
- **Counter Management**: Manages a counter stored in `counter.txt` to handle connections.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `webcolors` library (for RGB to color name conversion)
- `base64` library (for encoding and decoding)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install webcolors
```

## How It Works

The script operates by connecting to a server over a socket connection. It sends a predefined set of initial messages and processes the responses from the server.

### Commands

The following commands are processed by the script:

1. **Math Operations**: 
   - The script looks for math operations in the serverâ€™s response (e.g., `2 + 3`), solves them, and sends the result back.
   - It uses regular expressions to identify operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

2. **Base Decoding**: 
   - If the response contains a base-encoded message, it attempts to decode it using base85, base32, or base64.
   - Once decoded, the script checks the content and processes it further.

3. **Morse Code Decoding**: 
   - If the response contains morse code (e.g., `.- -... -.-.`), the script will convert it into readable text.
   - The morse code is translated using a predefined dictionary of Morse symbols.

4. **Braille Decoding**: 
   - The script can also decode Braille characters. It maps each Braille character to its corresponding alphabet letter.
   - The response is processed, and the decoded Braille message is returned.

5. **Hexadecimal Decoding**: 
   - The script can decode messages in hexadecimal format (e.g., `48656c6c6f`), converting them into readable text.
   - The decoded message is passed through additional processing (e.g., decoding morse or braille).

6. **RGB to Color Name**: 
   - If the response contains an RGB value in the format `(r, g, b)`, the script converts it into a color name using the `webcolors` library.

7. **Rewind and Find**: 
   - The script also supports rewinding and finding specific answers in the saved `answers.txt` file based on a number input (from 1 to 7).
   - It uses regular expressions to identify the "find" command and retrieves the relevant answer.

8. **Save Answers**: 
   - All responses are saved in `answers.txt`. The script logs each response it processes for later use.

### File Management

- **`answers.txt`**: This file stores the answers obtained from processing server responses. Each response is saved on a new line.
- **`counter.txt`**: This file keeps track of a counter. Each time the script is run, the counter is incremented to ensure unique port usage.

## Usage

### Command to Initiate

To start the script, use the following command:

```bash
python script.py --port <target_port>
```

Where:
- `<target_port>` is the port of the server you're connecting to.

This command will start the script and initiate a connection to the server on the specified port. The script will then begin sending and receiving messages as described above.

### Example:

```bash
python script.py --port 12345
```

This will connect the script to the server at port `12345` and start processing the responses.

## Example Interaction

1. The script sends the message `Stephane/dai/3SI5` to the server.
2. The server responds with a math operation: `5 + 3`.
3. The script solves the math problem and sends `8` back to the server.
4. The server may respond with a base64-encoded string.
5. The script decodes the base64 message and continues processing based on the decoded content.

### Changes made:
1. **Command to Initiate**: Added clear instructions on how to start the script by running the command with the port parameter (`python script.py --port <target_port>`).
2. **Example of Command**: Provided an example of using the command with a specific port (`python script.py --port 12345`).
